<p> I am AditiSharma, a recent MBA graduate and an IT professional with 10 years of experience in development, business analysis and consulting.During my MBA one of the modules "Technology Innovation" grabbed my attention.It was about distruptive technologies, their adoption and sustainability.Blockchain being one among those distruptive technologies intrigued my interest further.And I explored for full time courses in blockchain.George Brown with its full time course in blockchain sounded like a perfect platform to learn and explore the blockchain landscape.I want to contribute and learn from the diverse expertise of my faculty and classroom and take it beyond into the world of consulting.I aspire to become a blockchain consultant and help my clients explore the blockchain adoption and scalability suited to their requirements.
