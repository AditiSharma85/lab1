      - What is an HTML tag? Give three examples of tags?<br>
      An HTML tag is commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a Web page. At the core of HTML, tags provide the directions or recipes for the visual content that one sees on the Web.<br>
      Example of three html tags are:
&lt;htmlp&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
- What is an empty tag? How does it differ from a regular tag?<br>
An empty tag doesnt need a closing tag.Regular tags need a closing tag.<br>
- What is an attribute of an HTML tag?<br>
Attribute is a modifier for the HTML tag and provide additional information.<br>
- What is the correct way for HTML tags to nest?<br>
They must be closed in the inverse order of how they are defined, that means the last tag opened must be closed first.<br>
- How do you add an id to an HTML tag?<br>
The id attribute is a unique identifier which is used to specify the document. It is used by CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element. In CSS, the id attribute is used using # symbol followed by id.<br>
- How do you add a class to an HTML tag?<br>
The HTML class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name.So, all HTML elements with the same class attribute will get the same style.<br>
- Why would you use an ID vs a class?<br>
In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.<br>
- What is a type selector?<br>
A Type Selector (sometimes referred to as an Element Type Selector) matches elements with the corresponding element node name, such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags. Type selectors are generally used to make "broad stroke" changes to the style of a site<br>
- What is the head tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?<br>
It is used to contain specific information about a web page, often referred to as metadata. This information includes things like the title of the document (which is mandatory), as well as scripts or links to scripts, and CSS files.<br>
- Body is the body tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?<br>
It is used to contain a web page's content, including hyperlinks, images, tables, text, etc. It is required in every HTML document, and there may only be one &lt;body&gt; tag per page.<br>
